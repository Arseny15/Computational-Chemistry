# Bayesian-Optimization-and-in-Organic-Synthesis-Maximizing-Reaction-Yields

## **Overview**
This project applies **Bayesian Optimization (BO)** to optimize reaction conditions and maximize yields in **organic synthesis chemistry**. Optimizing reaction conditions is a complex and resource-intensive task, traditionally requiring extensive experimentation. **BO**, leveraging **Gaussian Process (GP) models**, provides an advanced optimization approach that efficiently reduces experimental workload while improving accuracy.  

## **Objective**
The study investigates the effectiveness of **BO** compared to a simpler **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** model in optimizing the yield of a **palladium-catalyzed direct arylation reaction**. By implementing **Expected Improvement (EI)** as the acquisition function, BO demonstrates superior predictive accuracy while significantly reducing experimental requirements.  

## **Key Features**
- **Python-based implementation** for reaction yield optimization.  
- **Bayesian Optimization (BO)** using **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**.  
- Comparison with **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** as a baseline model.  
- Optimization of **palladium-catalyzed direct arylation reaction**.  
- **Reduction in experimental workload** and improved efficiency.  

## **Why Bayesian Optimization?**
- Efficiently explores reaction conditions with fewer experiments.  
- Offers **higher predictive accuracy** than traditional regression models.  
- Scalable framework adaptable to **complex chemical systems**.  
- Provides a data-driven approach to enhance computational chemistry workflows.  

## **Results & Findings**
The results show that **BO with the EI acquisition function** significantly outperforms MLR in predicting and optimizing reaction yields. This study highlights the **practical potential of BO in computational chemistry**, providing a foundation for further research into its broader applications.
